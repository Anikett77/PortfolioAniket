# Aniket Portfolio

![visitor badge](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=aniket-portfolio.visitor-badge)

This is my portfolio website built with Next.js, featuring four primary sections: Home, About, Projects, and Contact. The site uses Framer Motion for animations, Fullpage.js for smooth transitions, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Project details are dynamically loaded from a JSON file.

This website represents my first major step into modern web development with Next.js and showcases my skills, creativity, and frontend development knowledge.
